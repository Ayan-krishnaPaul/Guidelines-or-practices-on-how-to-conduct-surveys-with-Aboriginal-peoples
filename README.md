# Case Study

## Guidelines or practices on how to conduct surveys with Aboriginal peoples.

This literature review explores the evolution of policies and practices in research involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, emphasizing the need for culturally appropriate, ethically sound, and inclusive methodologies. 
It highlights the shift from traditional, outsider-driven research to community-led frameworks, with examples like the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey and the Mayi Kuwayu Study illustrating successful adaptations. 
These studies prioritize Indigenous leadership and community-driven objectives, promoting research conducted with and for Indigenous communities rather than merely about them. 
The review aims to identify best practices, address current gaps, and suggest future research directions to enhance the accuracy and relevance of data for improved policy and health outcomes in Indigenous communities.
